# Getting Started

If you're looking to build applications that leverage Bitcoin's security with Ethereum's programmability, you're in the right place.

### What You Can Build on Kaon

Kaon enables developers to create applications that were previously impossible, combining Bitcoin's proven security model with full EVM smart contract capabilities. You can:

* Build DeFi applications directly secured by Bitcoin's architecture
* Deploy smart contracts that maintain UTXO-model security
* Create tokens that preserve Bitcoin's fundamental security features
* Develop cross-chain applications without bridges or wrapped tokens

### Getting Started with Kaon Testnet

To help you explore these capabilities, we provide a testnet environment where you can:

* Deploy and test smart contracts
* Create and manage tokens
* Build and test DeFi applications
* Experiment with UTXO-EVM interactions

Let's get you set up and deploying your first token on Kaon.
