# What is Kaon?

{% hint style="success" %}
Kaon's mission is to enable native programmability for Bitcoin - making Bitcoin truly interoperable, composable, and scalable.
{% endhint %}

Kaon is a breakthrough Layer 1 blockchain that makes Bitcoin truly programmable for the first time. By building directly on Bitcoin's UTXO model and security architecture while enabling complete EVM compatibility, Kaon eliminates the risks inherent in traditional bridges and oracles while unlocking Bitcoin's full potential for capital markets applications.

Unlike existing solutions that force Bitcoin to adapt to Ethereum's account-based model, Kaon maintains Bitcoin's native UTXO architecture while enabling developers to build sophisticated applications using familiar Ethereum tools. This means you can create secure DeFi applications on Bitcoin without sacrificing its fundamental security principles.

Through its innovative technical architecture, Kaon delivers:

* Direct and native compatibility with Bitcoin's UTXO model
* Complete EVM smart contract support
* Elimination of bridges, oracles, and vulnerable intermediaries
* Direct integration with existing developer tools
