Errors might occur if the input JSON is malformed, the referenced UTXOs are invalid or spent, or the output addresses are incorrect. Specific error information is not available in the provided documentation.

### Notes:

The created transaction is unsigned and needs to be signed using `signrawtransactionwithkey` or `signrawtransactionwithwallet` before being broadcasted to the network with `sendrawtransaction`. Setting a non-zero `locktime` also locktime-activates inputs.
