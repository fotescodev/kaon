1. The user initiates a transaction to transfer some tokens without holding the native gas token for transaction fees.
2. A portion of the transaction fee is paid using the tokens being transferred. In this case, some tokens are converted to Kaon tokens.
3. This gasless mechanism acts as a universal means for transaction fee management, making it possible to conduct transactions across different chains without needing the native gas token. This can later be adapted to use a stablecoin for even more stability and predictability.
4. The system accounts for slippage up to three times (Slippage X3) to ensure the transactionâ€™s success.

The gasless mechanism is designed to work across various blockchain networks, with Observers being introduced.
