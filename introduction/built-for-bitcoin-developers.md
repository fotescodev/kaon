# Built for Bitcoin Developers

Kaon provides Bitcoin developers with a familiar yet powerful platform to build DeFi applications, all without compromising Bitcoin's core principles. Hereâ€™s why Kaon is ideal for Bitcoin developers:

## UTXO-Native Design

**Seamless Compatibility**: Kaon stays true to Bitcoin's UTXO model, making it easy for Bitcoin developers to transition without learning new structures or adapting to an account-based system.

**Security and Privacy**: By leveraging the UTXO model, Kaon inherits built-in features like double-spending prevention and one-time addresses, which enhance security and privacy.

**Efficient Multi-Recipient Transactions**: Similar to Bitcoin, Kaon supports transactions with multiple recipients, making change management and fee optimization straightforward.

## Bitcoin-Compatible Scripting

**Extended Scripting**: Kaon expands Bitcoin's scripting capabilities while retaining compatibility with existing conventions. New opcodes like `OP_CAT`, `OP_CSFS`, and `OP_TXHASH` allow developers to implement more complex operations.

**Security Alignment**: The extended scripting capabilities are built to align with Bitcoin's security model, ensuring that the new functionality does not compromise the platform's security.

**Familiar Cryptography**: Kaon retains Bitcoin's private/public key structures, address prefixes, and transaction signing processes, letting developers use their existing cryptographic tools and knowledge.

## Developer Tools and Infrastructure

**Kaon CLI and RPC Interfaces**: With `kaon-cli` and `kaond`, developers can work with Bitcoin RPC standards, making it easy to manage wallets and interact with the blockchain using commands they are already familiar with.

**Bitcoin Libraries**: Support for libraries like `bitcoin-rust` ensures developers have access to familiar resources, simplifying the development process.

**Ordinals and BRC20 Support**: Kaon integrates support for Ordinals and BRC20, enabling developers to further explore and expand these Bitcoin-native technologies.

## Security-First Approach

**No External Dependencies**: Kaon addresses the security risks inherent in bridges, oracles, and rollups by providing a bridge-less and oracle-less architecture, thereby minimizing external points of failure.

**UTXO and Bitcoin Security**: By combining UTXO-based security with Bitcoin's cryptographic foundations, Kaon provides a secure and robust environment for developing DeFi solutions.

## Community Engagement

**Open-Source Commitment**: Kaon provides open-source tools and comprehensive documentation to empower the Bitcoin developer community.

**Collaborative Ecosystem**: Kaon encourages developers to contribute, ensuring the platform evolves to meet the community's needs and driving the growth of Bitcoin-based DeFi.
