# Who Should Use Kaon?

**Kaon** combines the strength of Bitcoin's UTXO model with the flexibility of Ethereum's EVM. This integration allows developers familiar with Bitcoin and Ethereum to easily create dApps and new Web3 use-cases.

## For Bitcoin Developers

If you're experienced with Bitcoin's UTXO model and scripting capabilities, Kaon extends these familiar concepts by incorporating EVM functionality:

* **Familiar Transaction Model**: Continue working with the UTXO-based transactions you're accustomed to, including transaction inputs, outputs, and Bitcoin scripts.
* **Enhanced Scripting with Smart Contracts**: Transition from basic Bitcoin scripts to advanced smart contracts using Solidity, enabling more complex and feature-rich dApps.
* **Direct Interaction with Bitcoin Assets**: Utilize Bitcoin assets within Kaon's environment without relying on centralized bridges or wrapped tokens.

## For EVM Developers

As an Ethereum developer proficient in Solidity and the account-based model, Kaon offers new avenues:

* **Access to Bitcoin's UTXO Model**: Expand your knowledge by integrating UTXO concepts into your development practices, enriching the types of applications you can build.
* **Native Bitcoin Asset Integration**: Interact directly with Bitcoin assets in your smart contracts, opening up possibilities for DeFi applications that include Bitcoin liquidity.
* **Familiar Development Tools**: Continue using tools like Remix, Truffle, Hardhat, Web3.js, and Ethers.js within the Kaon ecosystem.
